* Consistently pass FileLine as a value
* In type rank, there is an assumption that sizeof(pointer) == sizeof(unsigned long) which might not be true in all architectures
* Fix extra credit
* Do quiet NaN
* Fix ability to free program AST w/ dup interior pointers in declarations
* Remove explicit stack allocation operations and replace with add/sub to RSP
